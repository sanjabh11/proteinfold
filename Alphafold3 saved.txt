==============
awesome....i'm able to extract this much information on my webapp including 3d image extraction from the source website of alphafold3. What else can be -
1. extracted more?
2. improved further?

remember when I had little subject matter expertise, but still I do want to make this app useful for both students and researchers...now add on to the fact that I have little coding experibces too. so within the given code structure when you have access to github repo too, respondd to this question pls.

Add these base styles to your index.css or global CSS file:

css
Copy Code
/* src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
  --protein-viewer-bg: theme('colors.white');
  --protein-viewer-text: theme('colors.gray.800');
}

.dark {
  --protein-viewer-bg: theme('colors.gray.900');
  --protein-viewer-text: theme('colors.gray.100');
}

body {
  @apply antialiased;
}

.protein-viewer {
  @apply bg-protein-bg-light dark:bg-protein-bg-dark 
         text-protein-text-light dark:text-protein-text-dark 
         rounded-lg shadow-lg p-4 transition-colors duration-200;
}
This implementation:

Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
Supports system-wide dark mode
Persists theme preference
Provides smooth transitions between themes
Maintains your existing routing structure
Is fully typed with TypeScript
Would you like me to provide the updated versions of any other components to match this theme implementation?

Your conversation is getting long. We recommend starting a new chat for better quality responses.
 

pls share the details of what all the additional features we have on this webapp in comparison of the source alphafold website in tabular...
also include what all we don't have as shared earlier in tabular , which we would like to add
