Phase 1: Enhanced Visualization and Interaction
1. Multiple Visualization Modes
Description:

Provide different rendering styles such as cartoon, surface, sticks, and spheres in the 3D protein viewer to enhance user interaction and understanding of protein structures.

Implementation Steps:

Upgrade or Verify Visualization Library:
Analysis:
The current app uses ngl for molecular visualization.
ngl supports various representations.
Action:
Ensure that the latest version of ngl is installed:
unknown
Copy Code

npm install ngl@latest
 - Verify that it supports the required representations.
2. Modify ProteinViewer Component:

Update Props:
Ensure ProteinViewer.tsx accepts a representation prop, which can be 'cartoon', 'surface', 'ball+stick', 'spacefill', etc.
Implement Representation Logic:
In the useEffect hook where the structure is loaded, update the code to use the representation prop:
tsx
Copy Code
stage.loadFile(blob, { ext: 'pdb' }).then((component) => {
  component.addRepresentation(representationType, { ...options });
  component.autoView();
});
 - Ensure that when the `representation` prop changes, the viewer updates accordingly.
3. Create Rendering Controls in UI:

In ProteinDetail.tsx (or relevant page):
Add a UI control (e.g., a dropdown menu or a set of buttons) to allow users to select the visualization mode.
Bind the selected mode to the state and pass it down to the ProteinViewer component.
tsx
Copy Code
const [viewerStyle, setViewerStyle] = useState('cartoon');

// ...

<select
  value={viewerStyle}
  onChange={(e) => setViewerStyle(e.target.value)}
>
  <option value="cartoon">Cartoon</option>
  <option value="surface">Surface</option>
  <option value="ball+stick">Ball & Stick</option>
  <option value="spacefill">Spacefill</option>
</select>

// Pass viewerStyle to ProteinViewer
<ProteinViewer
  pdbData={structure.coordinates}
  representation={viewerStyle}
  // ... other props
/>
Testing:
Action:
Test each visualization mode to ensure that it renders correctly.
Switch between modes and verify that the protein structure updates without errors or performance issues.

Example:
unknown
Copy Code
ts
       interface Annotation {
         type: string;
         description: string;
         start: number;
         end: number;
       }
Store Annotations:
In the ProteinDetail component, store annotations in state after fetching.
Overlay Annotations in ProteinViewer:
Pass Annotations as Props:
Update ProteinViewer to accept an annotations prop.
Add Representations:
In ProteinViewer, loop over the annotations and add representations for each:
tsx
Copy Code
annotations.forEach((annotation) => {
  const selection = `${annotation.start}-${annotation.end}`;
  component.addRepresentation('spacefill', {
    sele: selection,
    color: 'red',
    opacity: 0.5,
  });
});
Enable User Interaction:
Add event listeners for hover and click events to display annotation details.
Implement Interactive Tooltips:
Use NGL Picking:
Utilize NGL's picking functionality to identify which part of the structure is being interacted with.
Display Tooltips:
Create a tooltip component that appears on hover or click, showing annotation details.
Add Annotation Controls to UI:
Annotation List:
Create a sidebar or panel listing all available annotations, grouped by type.
Toggle Visibility:
Allow users to toggle the visibility of each annotation type or individual annotations.
Filter Annotations:
Add search or filter capabilities to help users find specific annotations.
Testing:
Action:
Verify that annotations appear in the correct locations.
Test tooltips for correct display of information.

  color: 'black',
});
UI for Selecting Residues:

Structure Manipulation Controls:
Implement Reset and Orientation Controls:
Add buttons for actions like 'Reset View', 'Center on Selection', etc.
Use NGL methods like stage.autoView() for resetting.
Custom Mouse Controls (if needed):
If default controls are not sufficient, customize mouse controls for rotate, zoom, and pan.
